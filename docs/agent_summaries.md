# Stock Pick Game Project Summary

## Project Overview

This is a stock pick game project that allows users to make stock selections and track their performance. The project is built with a modern tech stack including Docker for containerization and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Work Completed

1. **Docker Configuration**
   - Created multiple Dockerfile configurations:
     - `Dockerfile` - Main application container
     - `Dockerfile.backend` - Backend service container
     - `Dockerfile.frontend` - Frontend service container
   - Set up docker-compose configurations for both development and production environments

2. **Development Environment**
   - Implemented development environment with hot-reloading
   - Created development-specific docker-compose configuration
   - Set up database backup functionality

3. **Deployment & CI/CD**
   - Configured GitHub Actions for automated deployment
   - Set up deployment keys and secrets
   - Created deployment analysis scripts
   - Implemented monitoring scripts for deployment actions

4. **Project Structure**
   - Organized codebase into clear directories:
     - `/frontend` - Frontend application code
     - `/backend` - Backend service code
     - `/docs` - Project documentation
     - `/scripts` - Utility scripts
     - `/tests` - Test files and configurations

## Pending Tasks

1. **Frontend Development**
   - Complete user interface implementation
   - Add stock selection interface
   - Implement real-time updates

2. **Backend Development**
   - Complete API endpoints
   - Implement stock data integration
   - Set up user authentication

3. **Testing**
   - Implement comprehensive test suite
   - Add integration tests
   - Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

4. **Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Add user guides
   - Document deployment procedures

## Initial Requirements

The project was initiated with the following key requirements:

1. Create a stock pick game where users can select stocks and track their performance
2. Implement a modern, containerized architecture using Docker
3. Set up automated deployment using GitHub Actions
4. Ensure development environment supports hot-reloading and easy local testing
5. Maintain clear documentation and project structure

## Technical Stack

- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Node.js for backend
- Modern frontend framework
- SQLite for development database
- Nginx for production serving

## Next Steps

1. Focus on completing the core game functionality
