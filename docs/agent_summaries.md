     - `Dockerfile.frontend` - Frontend service container
   - Set up docker-compose configurations for both development and production environments

2. **Development Environment**
   - Implemented development environment with hot-reloading
   - Created development-specific docker-compose configuration
   - Set up database backup functionality

3. **Deployment & CI/CD**
   - Configured GitHub Actions for automated deployment
   - Set up deployment keys and secrets
   - Created deployment analysis scripts
   - Implemented monitoring scripts for deployment actions

4. **Project Structure**
   - Organized codebase into clear directories:
     - `/frontend` - Frontend application code
     - `/backend` - Backend service code
     - `/docs` - Project documentation
     - `/scripts` - Utility scripts
     - `/tests` - Test files and configurations

## Pending Tasks

1. **Frontend Development**
   - Complete user interface implementation
   - Add stock selection interface
   - Implement real-time updates

2. **Backend Development**
   - Complete API endpoints
   - Implement stock data integration
   - Set up user authentication

3. **Testing**
   - Implement comprehensive test suite
   - Add integration tests
   - Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

4. **Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Add user guides
   - Document deployment procedures

## Initial Requirements

The project was initiated with the following key requirements:

1. Create a stock pick game where users can select stocks and track their performance
2. Implement a modern, containerized architecture using Docker
3. Set up automated deployment using GitHub Actions
4. Ensure development environment supports hot-reloading and easy local testing
5. Maintain clear documentation and project structure

## Technical Stack

- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Node.js for backend
- Modern frontend framework
- SQLite for development database
- Nginx for production serving

## Next Steps

1. Focus on completing the core game functionality
2. Implement user authentication and data persistence
3. Add real-time stock data integration
4. Enhance the user interface and experience
5. Complete the test suite
6. Finalize deployment procedures

## What Was Done

- The project was reverted to a classic, single-Dockerfile, single-service setup.
- Removed split Dockerfile.backend and Dockerfile.frontend, and all references to split images in docker-compose and GitHub Actions workflow.
- The frontend is now served with 'serve' on port 5173, and the backend runs on port 4556, as in the original working configuration.
- The deployment workflow was updated to only build and deploy the single image.
- Verified that the codebase matches the old, working state by comparing with commit 4c3ff9708d834076873906ac4ecfed4cfc0e9c33.

## What We Did

- Investigated and diagnosed a 502 error caused by a switch to split Dockerfiles and Nginx in the frontend container.
- Determined the root cause was a port mapping/config mismatch after switching to Nginx.
- Reverted all changes related to the split-image setup, restoring the classic deployment structure.
- Cleaned up all references to the split images and ensured the deployment pipeline is correct.
- Double-checked the diff to ensure a full and accurate revert.

## What Needs to Be Done

- Monitor the deployment to ensure the app is working as expected.
- Continue frontend and backend feature development as outlined in the project summary.
- Complete any pending tasks from the project roadmap (UI, API, authentication, real-time updates, etc.).
- Ensure documentation and deployment instructions remain up to date.

## Original Instructions (Summarized)

- The user requested a full review and correction of the deployment setup for a stock pick game app.
- The app should show the current week's picks, allow three users to log in and make picks, and display the winner on weekends.
- Authentication is via simple password and long-lived JWTs.
- There should be a single screen showing the current week, pick history, and winner, with detailed stock price info.
- The agent was instructed to review the entire codebase, make all necessary changes, and not stop until the assignment was complete, including both frontend and backend work.
- The agent was to run all scripts and commands on the user's behalf, and document helpful instructions for future agents.

# Agent Summary: Atlas Orion Phoenix (March 19, 2024)

## What Was Done

- Successfully deployed the stock pick game application to production at stockpickgame.tideye.com
- Set up and configured environment variables for production deployment
- Implemented Docker containerization for both frontend and backend services
- Created and configured GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- Fixed deployment issues related to missing `/app/data` directory
- Simplified deployment workflow to ensure reliable container updates

## What We Did

- Configured production environment variables and secrets
- Set up Docker services and container orchestration
- Implemented automated deployment through GitHub Actions
- Fixed critical deployment issues:
  - Added directory creation in Dockerfile
  - Simplified container management in deployment workflow
- Monitored deployment status and container health
- Ensured proper database persistence and backup procedures

## What Needs to Be Done

- Investigate current deployment status by curling stockpickgame.tideye.com
- Verify all services are running correctly:
  - Frontend service on port 5173
  - Backend service on port 4556
  - Database persistence
- Complete remaining frontend features:
  - User authentication interface
  - Stock pick submission form
  - Historical data display
- Implement remaining backend functionality:
  - Stock data integration
  - User authentication
  - Weekly pick management
- Add comprehensive testing suite
- Complete documentation updates

## Original Instructions (Summarized)

The project is a stock pick game where:

- Users can view current week's picks in a table
- Three players (Patrick, Logan, and Taylor) can log in and make picks
- Picks can be made up until Sunday
- Previous week's picks roll over if no new pick is made
- A single screen shows current picks and history
- Winners are prominently displayed
- Stock information includes Monday open, daily open/close prices
- Holiday handling uses previous day's prices
- Authentication uses long-living JWTs (1-year duration)
- JWT is refreshed on each page visit

## Next Steps for Investigation

1. First, curl the production URL to check current status:

   ```bash
   curl https://stockpickgame.tideye.com
   ```

2. If issues are found:
   - Check container status on the VPS
   - Review GitHub Actions workflow status
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check application logs
   - Ensure database persistence

3. Focus on completing core functionality:
   - User authentication
   - Stock pick submission
   - Historical data display
   - Winner calculation
   - Real-time updates
